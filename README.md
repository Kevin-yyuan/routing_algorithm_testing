# A/B Test Analysis for a New Routing Algorithm

This project analyzes the results of an A/B test for a new eco-friendly routing algorithm. The goal is to determine if the new algorithm provides a significant reduction in fuel consumption and to assess the financial impact of the change.

## Files

*   `ab_test_analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, including statistical tests and financial modeling.
*   `case_study.md`: A detailed case study summarizing the project, methodology, results, and final recommendation.
*   `generate_data.py`: A Python script to generate the sample data for the A/B test.
*   `data/delivery_data.csv`: The sample data used in the analysis.
*   `images/distributions.png`: The distribution plots generated by the notebook.

## How to Run the Analysis

1.  Make sure you have Python 3, Jupyter Notebook, and the required libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`) installed.
2.  Run the `generate_data.py` script to create the sample data:
    ```
    python3 generate_data.py
    ```
3.  Open and run the `ab_test_analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
